# Love or Money? 
## I analyse five classic murder mysteries written in the early 1920s by crime writers who would later go on to join [The Detection Club](https://www.fantasticfiction.com/c/detection-club/). What is more prominent in these mysteries -- love or money?

The novels mentioned here are in the public domain and the texts are taken from [Project Gutenberg](https://http://www.gutenberg.org/).

* '[The Mysterious Affair at Styles](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/863)' (1920) by [Agatha Christie](https://https://www.agathachristie.com/)

* '[Whose Body?](https://http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/58820)' (1923) by [Dorothy L. Sayers](https://https://www.sayers.org.uk/)

I've used a rather simplistic method here -- a count of the number of times the words 'love' and 'money' appear in the texts of these novels. But the results are illuminating nonetheless!

To do the word count I've used the [spaCy](https://https://spacy.io/) library for natural language processing in Python.
